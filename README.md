# ConsoleBankC-
with this small project i made a console bank application, capable of making a client and that client can make a bank account of choice.
these different bankaccounts have different rules
checking account can deposit and withdraw up to 0 accountbalance. 
saving account can only deposit money, not withdraw. this was to make if really different from the others. 
a credit account can make withdrawels up to -2500 euros. 

## what could i do better?
i could make it so that the app doesn't have 1 run through. meaning right now it runs ones and runs to the end and stops.
I could make it so that these functions get recursively called upon failure and that the accountInterfacing method always keeps calling itself after
an operation. But sinds I spends too much time on this already i'll keep it like this and see this project as a good reminder of console apps in c#.
